.. _CodingStyle:

PINT coding style
-----------------

   - Code should follow PEP8_. This constrains whitespace,
     formatting, and naming.
   - Code should follow the black_ style.
   - Use the standard formats for imports:

      - The only abbreviated imports are ``import numpy as np``,
        ``import astropy.units as u``, and
        ``import astropy.constants as c``; always use these modules
        in this form.
      - If you want to import a deeply nested module, use
        ``from pint.models import parameter``.
      - If you are using a function frequently or the module name
        is long, use ``from pint.utils import interesting_lines``
      - Sort imports with isort_.
      - Remove all unused imports.
      - Do not abbreviate any other imports.

   - Modules should list all public functions, classes, and constants
     in ``__all__``. You can use the order of ``__all__`` to specify
     the order that things appear in the documentation.
   - Every public function or class should have a docstring. It
     should be in the correct format (numpy guidelines_).
   - Do not abbreviate public names (for example, use "Residuals"
     not "resids"). If *aboslutely* necessary, make certain that there
     is One True Abbreviation and that it is used everywhere.
   - Raise an exception if the code cannot continue and produce
     correct results.
   - Use :mod:`~astropy.logger` to signal conditions the user should
     know about but that do not prevent the code from producing
     correct results. Be conservative; normal operation should
     generate no warnings or else users will ignore them (think
     LaTeX warnings).
   - Use keyword argument names when calling a function with more
     than two or three arguments.
   - Use :class:`~astropy.units.Quantity` for things with physical
     units.
   - If you need a :class:`~astropy.time.Time` object use
     ``from pint.pulsar_mjd import Time``; this ensures that you have
     available the ``pulsar_mjd`` time format.
   - PINT should work with python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and later. There
     is no need to maintain compatibility with older versions, so use
     approprate modern constructs like sets, iterators, and the string
     ``.format()`` method.
   - Use six_ to manage python 2/3 compatibility problems.
